Match 3 Game

Theme: The theme of this match 3 game is around using items to defeat monsters. You choose from one
of three heroes (all to which are identical besides how they look). When you match 3 you will attack
the enemy dealing damage based off of how many you match. I've chosen making this match 3 game to
work as a mini battle system to an RPG type of game.

System: Based off the example given in class on "how to build a match 3" I used a lot of it's ideas
when creating the game. The system uses the game object's sprite to determine matches and switching.
For example switching a sword with an adjacent tile will actually just swap the sprites of both render
items. The fall down effect simply finds the empty tiles after a match and does the same kind of
swap with the empty and above tiles however all sprites above the empty one move and new sprites are
spawned at the top. All sprites are the same value, there are no bonus points.

Levels of difficulty: There are 3 levels of difficulty, always starting on easy when you play the game.
Easy, or "1", only has matchable tiles on the starting board and drop tiles. It also has a skeleton
for you to fight. Medium, or "2", also starts with only matchable tiles, however some unmatchable tiles 
fall when you complete matches. It has a fearsome orc you must battle. Lastly hard or "3", starts 
with some of those unmatchable tiles and more have a chance to fall during the game, with an orc warlock
to fight. I feel a match 3 game shouldn't be about being fast so the time limit is a lengthy
6 minutes for each difficulty, and because of the unmatchable tiles the number of turns you have increase
with difficulty as well as needed points. You get 10 points per tile matched, match 3 = 30 points.

Bonus/Interesting: The match 3 game is now a fighting minigame. Matching items deal damage to the enemy
while taking turns deals damage to the player.
